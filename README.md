## Опис

Ex-Book Change is a mobile version of a web application for book exchange and sale, designed for the convenience and efficiency of book enthusiasts. Utilizing modern Firebase technologies, including Realtime Database, Storage, and Authentication, I have created an intuitive and functional application that will help you free up your bookshelves and find new connections with people who share your love for books.

With Ex-Book Change, you can easily exchange or sell books to other users. It's the perfect solution for those who want to contribute to book circulation while finding something new to read. Each user can create advertisements for their books, edit them, or delete them as needed. With a user-friendly interface, users can quickly find books of interest, add them to favorites, and communicate with book owners through an integrated chat.
