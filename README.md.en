# Ex-Book Change

## Description
Ex-Book Change is a mobile version of a web application designed for exchanging and selling books, tailored for the convenience and efficiency of book enthusiasts. Utilizing modern Firebase technologies, including Realtime Database, Storage, and Authentication, I have created an intuitive and functional app that helps users declutter their bookshelves and connect with others who share their love for books.

With Ex-Book Change, you can easily trade or sell your books to other users. It is the perfect solution for those who want to contribute to the circulation of books while finding something new to read. Every user can create listings for their books, edit them, or delete them as needed. Thanks to a user-friendly interface, users can quickly find books of interest, add them to their favorites, and communicate with book owners through the built-in chat feature.

### Key features of Ex-Book Change include:
1. **Registration and Authentication:** A simple registration and login process via Firebase Authentication ensures security and reliability.
2. **Profile Editing:** Users can add and update their personal information, including personal and contact details.
3. **Creating Listings:** Add new books for exchange or sale, complete with descriptions, photos, and other details.
4. **Editing and Deleting Listings:** The ability to modify or remove book information as needed.
5. **Search and Add to Favorites:** An intuitive search function allows users to quickly find the books they are interested in and add them to their favorites list.
6. **Viewing Profiles:** Users can view other members' profiles, see their listings, and get additional details.
7. **Chat:** A built-in chat feature allows users to communicate with others, discuss exchange or sale details, and build connections.

Ex-Book Change is designed to facilitate book exchanges and ensure a pleasant experience for all users. The app promotes the creation of a community of book lovers who can share their favorite editions and make new friends.
